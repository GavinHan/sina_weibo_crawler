Sina Weibo Crawler

The program is based on yaml/pymongo, which is python library .
Environment: Python 2.7.5 [GCC 4.8.1] on linux (Ubuntu 12.04)

Notes:

1. The crawler could crawling weibo/follows/fans/info. I will be add comment/at/retweet in the future.

2. Enter the conf folder and open conf.yaml, sign in your username password,you can add multiple accounts. Then you should write in the startuid.

3. You can choose the form of storage file or mongodb, if you choose the file storage you should write the position in conf.yaml then just run command "python graph.py" in shell.


Enjoy~ :-)
